# Long Short Term Memory Machine Learning Model for Price Prediction

This repository includes the code and dataset necessary to implement a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model designed to predict Microsoft stock prices. The LSTM model leverages historical stock data, using a sequence of past prices to forecast future price movements, providing a robust approach to time-series prediction. The data has been pre-processed for optimal model performance, and the code is structured to allow easy adjustments to model parameters, such as the number of epochs, batch size, and sequence length, enabling customization based on specific forecasting requirements.
